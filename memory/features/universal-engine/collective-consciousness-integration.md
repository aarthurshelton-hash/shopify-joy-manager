# Memory: features/universal-engine/collective-consciousness-integration
Updated: just now

The 'Collective Consciousness' logic is integrated into the Music (Heart), Soul (Spirit), and Consciousness domain adapters. This insight, inspired by the phenomenon of shared understanding during music or movie experiences, allows the engine to detect 'collective market entrainment'—the synchronization of human thought and emotion as a temporal pattern that influences market behavior.

## Scientific Foundation
- **Kuramoto Model**: Coupled oscillator synchronization (K_c ≈ 0.1592)
- **Integrated Information Theory (Φ)**: Consciousness measurement (threshold: 0.618, golden ratio)
- **Neural Binding Theory**: Gamma-wave coherence in shared attention
- **Social Resonance Theory**: Limbic synchronization in groups

## Mathematical Modules Added
1. `collectiveEntrainment.ts`: Kuramoto order parameter, phase coherence, Φ calculation
2. `scientificFormulations.ts`: DFT, Hilbert transform, Shannon entropy, Hurst exponent, fractal dimension, Bayesian update, Lyapunov exponent

## Entrainment States
- **Chaotic** (r < 0.16): "Every trader for themselves. The herd has scattered."
- **Transitional** (r ≈ 0.16): "Something's brewing. The collective unconscious stirs."
- **Entrained** (r > 0.48): "Minds aligned. The market breathes as one organism."
- **Supercoherent** (r > 0.85 + Φ > 0.618): "MAXIMUM RESONANCE. The market has achieved enlightenment."

## Integration Points
- UniversalSynthesizer now calculates entrainment state per prediction
- Confidence boosted 30% during supercoherent states, reduced 30% during chaotic
- Scientific metrics (Hurst, fractal dimension, entropy) included in every signal
