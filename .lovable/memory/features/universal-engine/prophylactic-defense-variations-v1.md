Updated: now

The 'En Pensent' engine now recognizes **12 distinct prophylactic defense sub-archetypes**, enabling deeper pattern recognition for defensive chess positions. These variations map directly to market trading strategies for cross-domain intelligence.

## Prophylactic Variations

1. **Petrosian Overprotection** - Key square fortification beyond necessity → Diversified hedging
2. **Karpov Stranglehold** - Slow positional asphyxiation → Gradual accumulation
3. **Nimzowitsch Restraint** - Blockade of pawn advances → Regulatory capture
4. **Tigran Pivot** - Defensive piece repositioning → Sector rotation
5. **Hedgehog Coil** - Compact structure ready to spring → Consolidation before breakout
6. **Berlin Wall** - Solid endgame fortress → Flight to quality
7. **Fortress Construction** - Impregnable defensive setup → Capital preservation
8. **Prophylactic Exchange** - Trades to eliminate threats → Position unwinding
9. **Waiting Move Mastery** - Zugzwang induction → Cash position waiting
10. **Elastic Defense** - Flexible retreat then counterattack → Controlled drawdown
11. **Pressure Absorption** - Absorbing initiative without breaking → Buying the dip

## Implementation
- `prophylacticVariations.ts`: Full classification engine with 12 sub-archetypes
- `signatureExtractor.ts`: Integrated to auto-detect when archetype is prophylactic_defense
- `getLastProphylacticAnalysis()`: Exported function to retrieve sub-archetype details
- `getProphylacticTradingSignal()`: Maps variations to hold/accumulate/hedge/reduce actions

## Cross-Domain Application
Each variation includes a `marketAnalogy` field that translates the chess pattern into a trading strategy, enabling the unified engine to apply defensive chess wisdom to market risk management.
